The project ICSs' will replace traditional / inefficient biomass stoves in the baseline. 
 
The prevalent use of traditional / inefficient cooking technologies in Kenya results in significant GHG emissions from use of non-renewable biomass (NRB) sourced unsustainably. Furthermore, the traditional solid biomass based cooking releases significant amounts of smoke, particulate matter (PM), exposing the primary cook to hazardous levels of indoor air pollution (IAP). The project ICSs are designed to be thermally more efficient than baseline stoves and hence reduce fuel consumption, cooking time and smoke, PM emissions. Thus the project reduces GHG emission, while simultaneously creating cleaner cooking environment for women and reduced IAP exposure to women and children.

A.S. involves in the collection and utilization of landfill gas (LFG) to generate electricity, with an installed capacity of 12.077 MWe .  The proposed activity is located at the Şanlıurfa landfill site in Turkey, which serves as the primary landfill for the city of Şanlıurfa. With a population of 2.17 million, Şanlıurfa is the 8th largest city in Turkey. The landfill site receives an average of 1200 tons   of waste per day. The baseline scenario involves managing the landfill without any utilization of landfill gas. An average of 75.18 GWh/year electricity is estimated to be supplied to the national grid. Overall, the project activity is estimated to reduce approximately 300,000 tCO2e of emissions per year once reaching to full capacity. 

The proposed project activity entails implementing a landfill cover and installing a gas extraction system, which will capture landfill gas and channel it to gas engines for the purpose of electricity generation. It is estimated that the total capacity of the project will reach 12.077  MWe at full capacity. The electricity produced from this process will be supplied to the national grid.

The project has a total installed capacity of 175.5 MW, an annual net electricity generation of 403,955 MWh and an emission reduction of 276,706 tCO2 each year. The electricity generated by the project supplies to the National Electric System (SEN in Spanish).
It is expected that, when the project becomes fully operational, will displace fossil fuel fired power stations avoiding the emission of 316,417 tCO2 each year and 1,936,963 tCO2 during the first crediting period. 
As the project activity is a greenfield renewable energy power plant, the scenario existing prior its implementation is a semi-desert, sparse vegetated, coastal winded pasture and shrub land, where neither facilities nor crops existed previously.
According to the ACM0002, as the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant, the baseline scenario is the “electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”. Baseline scenario would be a continuation of the current practice.
The project activity increases the percentage of renewable sourced power in the Chilean grids, promoting the growth of renewable capacity and diversifying the Chilean generation mix, significantly contributing to the sustainable development of the region. This represents a quite important solution, as the SIC (Central Interconnected System) electric generation mix was mainly weighted towards fossil fuels.

The project activity will result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTL landfill through the ways below:
- Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators (implemented and running);
- Supply consumers through a dedicated pipeline (implemented and running);
- The amount of electricity generated in the project activity will be part used for self-consumption at CTL landfill facilities and the surplus part will be exported to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil fueled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development (not implemented yet, but already included in the CDM Project).
It is important to highlight that currently the energetic use of the biogas in the project activity is through the selling of LFG to consumers (dedicated pipeline) and those consumers generates electricity to the grid. In the registered PDD is already contemplated one electricity generation plant which is not implemented yet by the project proponent, due to company internal arrangements as well as market conditions and products availability.
The landfill began its operation on 24 November 2010, receiving of household waste (Class II-A and II-B). The increased area of the landfill is 704.106 m² incorporated to the existent landfill area of 1.123.590 m². Thus, the total landfill area considering the increased area is 1.827.696 m². There is the possibility of increasing the waste disposal area, however this possibility will be analyzed in the future.
EcoUrbis Ambiental S.A.  is the company responsible for the implementation and operation of the CTL landfill and also, it is responsible, since October/2004, for collection services and disposal of solid waste in region East and South of the city of São Paulo (covering around 6,000,000 of inhabitants) under a concession for twenty years, renewable for another twenty years.

The Clean Energy LLC has wind farm a capacity of 49.6 MW and generate (net) 168.5 GWh of electricity per year.

On 25th June 2013, The Salkhit wind farm started commercial operation. The Salkhit wind farm generates renewable electricity using wind power resources and sells the generated output to the Central Energy System (CES, or the grid) on the basis of a power purchase agreement (PPA). In addition, the Salkhit wind farm also aims to lead renewable energy generation from wind in Mongolia, as the Salkhit wind farm was the first grid connected wind farm in Mongolia. The Salkhit wind farm generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants that is supplied to Grid.

Thus, Salkhit wind farm installed capacity is 49.6 MW of renewable energy power generation and supplies to the Grid of 164 GWh of electricity generated from renewable energy annually.

A. Project scenario is the operation of 31 sets of wind turbines with a total capacity of 50MW which will supply an annual generation of 164GWh to grid and replace same amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to grid. According to ACM0002 applied, the project is renewable electricity activity.
B. The baseline scenario of the project is the electricity supply of equal amount as the project from the grid. The baseline scenario of the project is the same as the scenario prior to the start of implementation of project activity.

The Project boundary included the project site and all power plants connected physically to the grid.

As the Grid is dominated by thermal power generation, the Salkhit wind farm activity is leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The second crediting period for the proposed project is from 24/06/2020 to 23/06/2027 and estimated emission reduction is in the second crediting period are 1,332,835tCO2e. The average annual emission reduction is estimated by 190,405 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for the 2nd crediting period.

Sustainable development
As the very first wind farm in Mongolia the Salkhit wind farm is greatly assisting the country in stimulating the commercialisation of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets. The Salkhit wind farm is helping to reduce GHG emissions versus the coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the Salkhit wind farm is improving air quality and local livelihoods and promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.
The specific goals of the project are to:
• generate electricity;
• help to stimulate the implementation of wind power in Mongolia;
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia compared to a business-as-usual scenario;

Prior to the implementation of the Project, the Manaus landfill was basically a landfill with has minimal control of surface water and leachate and no control of landfill gas (LFG).
The purpose of the project activity is to collect landfill gas (LFG) at the Manaus Landfill and to combust the extracted LFG over a seven year-period, using a high efficient enclosed flare, thereby generating electricity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). 
The project involved the construction of a LFG collection system consisting of horizontal trenches and vertical LFG extraction wells, centrifugal blower(s), and all other supporting mechanical and electrical subsystems and appurtenances necessary to collect the LFG.

The LFG collected from the site is combusted in an enclosed LFG flare with full process controls and instrumentation installed and operating. The state-of-the-art flare is capable of providing sufficient temperature and retention time of the extracted LFG for complete destruction of hydrocarbons.

In the baseline scenario, the target households are dependent on traditional wood stoves for cooking. The use of firewood for daily cooking is not only one of the causes of deforestation but also indoor air pollution affecting directly or indirectly the health the women and children. There is also a marginal use of LPG in some households, due to the subsidy offered by the Indian government which does enable access to LPG but not continued usage. Pilot studies show that in the target area, the vast majority of the households is primarily dependent on firewood and using traditional three stone or in efficient cooking technology.

The project is an alternative to dispatching existing and developing new, fossil fuel based and greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive, power generation plants connected to the electricity grid (the baseline situation). The substitution of the generation of more GHG intensive electricity will lead to GHG emission reductions that will be monitored during the lifetime of the project activity.


This project activity is a voluntary initiative of the project participants and Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE (RGWE) as the Project Developer. The relation between the Project Participants is based on a tender for the right to build, own and operate the project based on a Power Purchase Agreement with EETC. Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE, which is a consortium of ENGIE (France), Toyota Tsusho – Eurus (Japan) and Orascom Construction (Egypt), submitted a successful proposal and was awarded with the right to develop the project. The RGWE project will be connected to Egypt’s national grid and all its energy will be sold to EETC based on the tariff established by the auction process. The project achieved financial close on 14 December 2017, which is the date where construction agreements were enacted, and is expected to reach full commercial operations around 24 months later.


The project boundary includes the project power plant and each of its power units and all power plants/units physically connected to the same electricity grid that the power plant is connected to. The RGWE project is aligned with Egypt’s governmental policies to increase NCRE generation to 30% of total energy demand by 2035. To pursue this objective and the resulting GHG mitigation, Egypt has enacted diverse incentives and promotional policies and is planning to establish a national, or even regional, carbon market to attract foreign direct investment.","730788","ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources","Large Scale","Standalone",""

In the rural areas in India, the predominant means of cooking are traditional cook stoves that use woody biomass as fuel. The smoke and fumes from these traditional inefficient stoves contribute heavily to indoor air pollution, which overall claim approximately 400,000 lives per year in India . In rural areas of India, households are either not connected to the grid or in households even with grid connectivity, there are frequent power outages and low voltage so rural households use kerosene for indoor lighting, which also contributes to indoor air pollution and GHG emissions. 

The proposed small-scale project activity involves marketing, distributing, and financing improved cookstove and solar lighting systems, for low-income households and microentrepreneurs in India. Future sales of solar lighting systems may happen in any state but within the geographic boundary of the PoA i.e. the country of India. However, it will be ensured at all times that the threshold for SSC projects is not exceeded and the PoA eligibility criteria are met.

These products provide clean energy for cooking and renewable energy for lighting. The cookstoves distributed under the VPA replaces traditional cookstoves thereby reducing the amount of fuelwood used for cooking in the baseline by households and thus reducing GHG emissions corresponding to the fuelwood saving by the project activity. The solar lighting systems replace kerosene-based lamps in households, which would have resulted in GHG emissions due to burning of fossil fuel i.e. kerosene.

It is considered that 80% of the population in Burkina Faso is poor, living in rural areas and cooking with traditional cookstoves which have a very poor thermal efficiency; as a result, more than 5,000,000 tons of wood are used as fuel every year.
The following energy efficiency project proposed by Solidargo, the Association for the Protection of the Environment and Rural Development (APEDR), CO2logic and with technical support of Tiipaalga consists in reducing the consumption of cooking wood by rural households through the distribution of a more economical technology for cooking wood: the Foyer 3 Pierres Amélioré (F3PA) in banco. This technology, initially developed by the tiipaalga Association, has already proved its worth in different projects. The success of these projects demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired by tiipaalga for this type of programme. The association will use its experience for this new project in the Passoré province.
This project will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions thanks to the quantity of wood saved through the implementation of 04 VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities). The main goal of this project is to extend the distribution of the F3PA technology in banco to 12,000 households in the province of Passoré and thus contribute to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce poverty among rural households.

This will be achieved through distribution and installation of LPG units that are fitted with a smart meter to track and monitor LPG usage by the end-users. The project adopts a Pay as You Go (PAYG) approach to accelerate access to LPG by the end-users. The project acitivity also aims to contribute towards sustainable development goals. The specific description of the project activity is as follows:
a)	The project entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas.
b)	The project developer is Circle Gas, who will have the formal responsibility of the Project activity.
c)	The VPA implementor for this project activity is M-Gas Kenya, and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales database, collecting baseline information, and co-ordinating the annual monitoring process. 
d)	The project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer. 
e)	The goal of the project is to accelerate access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene.

The aim of the project activity is to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves used in the baseline, with LPG units which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other household air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. Household Air Pollution (HAP) is one of the largest health risk factors for mortality in Kenya with about 21,560 deaths attributed to HAP annually . Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of BC and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health (SDG 3).  
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of black carbon and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health.Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: the project will create employment to many people especially the youths who will be employed as field sales and service teams, and the overall management of the programme (SDG 8). 

The project boundary for the VPA is the Republic of Kenya. 
The legal ownership of the products generated belongs to Circle Gas. The end-users sign a carbon rights waiver form, at the time of installation of the Circle Gas LPG unit, which transfers the carbon rights to Circle Gas.

The household biogas plants utilize cattle dung in the digester for the production of biogas which is burnt in gas stoves for household cookings. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non-renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas.

The African Stove Company Ltd. (TASC) is the coordinating/managing entity (CME) of the PoA and is the sole implementer of the VPA. TASC’s mission is financing and developing high-impact climate mitigation projects. 
 
The VPA is an activity that was originally anticipated to be included as a CPA under a CDM PoA (6864: Fuel Efficient Stoves in Africa ) and is now transitioning from the CDM to the Gold Standard under the PoA GS11009: TASC Clean Cooking PoA. The VPA is therefore retroactive in nature, as the first ICS was distributed in Zambia on 26th August 2020. 

The VPA is implemented in communities Zambia where woodfuel is the primary source of energy for cooking and open, 3-stone fires are commonplace. 

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs.

In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions.

At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database. It is anticipated that the remaining ICS will be distributed by April 2021.","431949","GS TPDDTEC v3.1","Large Scale","VPA","11009"

Most families in Uganda cook with traditional inefficient cookstoves that consume large amounts of wood-based fuels (firewood or charcoal). This project is targeting the urban and peri-urban context of Northern and Eastern Regions of Uganda, where families tend to use charcoal as the main cooking fuel despite the fact that the price of charcoal has increased over time. The production of charcoal is increasing the rate of deforestation and land degradation, and their combustion is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. In addition to the environmental consequences, there are serious health implications related with the inefficient cooking methods through the exposure on the smoke and other emissions. The project will address the challenges above by reducing the consume of charcoal during the cooking activities.

The secondary aluminum raw materials put on the market by AS METAL correspond to the requirements of the European Industrial Standards (Recyclable materials EN 13920 1-16:2003 Aluminum and aluminum alloys. Scrap.); the American Standards INSTITUTE OF SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES INC, as well as to the Directives and the European Environmental Regulations (Regulation 333/2011 establishing the conditions under which certain aluminum and iron wastes are no longer considered as waste). 
The technologies used by AS METAL COM SRL allow us to recover and separate metal waste with a fraction mass mainly of aluminum resulting from the processing of secondary aluminum raw materials and other ferrous and non-ferrous metal substances which in turn are put on the market in accordance with the industry standards that govern them. Our technological processes guarantee a high recovery efficiency not only through the reported quantities but especially through their quality. 

The output capacity of the aluminum recycling plant is given by the types of processed waste and is between 49.000 up to 77.500 tons/year. 
The project activity is located on the industrial platform of AS METAL of 35,000 sqm. in the southern part of Bucharest, capital of Romania.

The main goal of the project is the reduction of CO2 emissions through aluminum recycling, displacing the primary aluminum production from raw materials (mined minerals, bauxite). In the case of primary aluminum production from raw materials, the process has a much greater consumption of energy and therefor a much higher environmental impact regarding CO2 emissions.

The activity of the project is a model for other similar aluminum recycling facilities in Romania and Eastern Europe, which deliver sustainable development. Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements and with the European circular economy (aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources) directives.

"10823","Solar Drip Irrigation for Smallholder Farmers in Morocco","atmosfair gGmbH","Gold Standard Certified Project","8,7,13","Solar Thermal - Electricity","Morocco","The project provides smallholder farmers in Morocco access to clean electricity to power their irrigation systems. This is achieved through the installation and operation of solar PV systems replacing fossil fuel-powered equipment.
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Moroccan economy. In many areas, precipitation levels are low, meaning that agricultural activity can only be sustained through irrigation. Inefficient pumping and irrigation systems have contributed to the decline of groundwater levels in Morocco, threatening soil fertility. Farmers without access to grid electricity usually power their pumping systems with diesel and butane gas, which they often source over long distances. Furthermore, they are dependant on fossil fuel prices.
This project allows farmers to become independant of fossil fuels through the hire purchase of a PV system, which they pay off over a period of 6 years. This does not create extra costs for farmers but instead saves them money, as they no longer need to purchase fuel. In order to obtain a PV system through this project, farmers are required to switch to a water-efficient drip irrigation system. Beyond reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the project thus helps to promote resource-efficient and sustainable agriculture.","7537","AMS-I.A.

The use of non-renewable woody biomass contributes to deforestation and emits a lot of toxic smoke. Gas represents an alternative energy to the use of woody biomass for the cooking needs of households and street food vendors. Promoting the use of this energy therefore makes it possible to transfer household energy demand to another fuel, thus easing the pressure on the vegetation cover. In addition, gas cooking significantly reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particle emissions, thus contributing to the fight against climate change. Gas cooking also has a health impact, as it considerably reduces the inhalation of harmful fumes by users, while providing incomparable cooking comfort. Mivo Energie aims to remove these barriers to adoption of this clean and economical cooking method by developing networks for the distribution of quality equipment and gas refills, and by setting up innovative financial services to facilitate access for vulnerable households.","28127","GS TPDDTEC v3.1","Large Scale","Standalone",""

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

The project focuses on transforming degraded pasturelands, previously used for extensive cattle ranching, into thriving forests of tropical hardwoods using a proven, nature-based approach. These mixed stands primarily consist of native species alongside teak, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.

Spanning four reforestation sites in remote northern Costa Rica, the project covers a total area of 1,527 hectares, with 978 hectares certified under the Gold Standard for reforestation. Approximately 20% of the project area remains untouched as old-growth and secondary forest, as well as wetlands, which serve as crucial habitats and biological corridors for endangered species. These include the diminishing Atlantic lowland rainforest fauna, such as the majestic Great Green Macaw. One of the project’s areas, La Virgen, is situated near Braulio Carrillo National Park, further enhancing its ecological significance.

Managing the reforested areas sustainably is a key priority of the project, which includes the practice of selective harvesting. This method ensures that timber extraction is carefully controlled to minimize environmental impact, protect forest integrity, and promote natural regeneration. By selectively harvesting individual trees rather than clear-cutting large areas, the project not only supports long-term forest health and biodiversity but also enhances carbon sequestration, reinforcing its commitment to ecological stewardship.

Additionally, the project is situated within two UNESCO-recognized biosphere reserves, 'Agua y Paz' and 'Cordillera Volcánica Central,' underscoring its global environmental importance. By restoring these ecosystems, the initiative contributes to preserving and increasing biodiversity while combating deforestation in a highly sensitive region.
Beyond its environmental goals, the BaumInvest project prioritizes socio-economic benefits for the local communities. It generates secure, long-term employment with fair working conditions, fostering a sustainable livelihood for people in this rural area. Active community involvement is encouraged, and wherever possible, resources and products needed for the reforestation are sourced locally, supporting regional economic development and strengthening the local value chain.","10602","Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology","Micro Scale","Standalone",""

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.","42222","AMS-II.G.

As a result, huge amounts of firewood are being wasted and the more efficient ceramic stoves have a great potential to reduce the destructive extraction of firewood in Kakamega and its neighboring forests Kisere, Bunyala, Kibiri and Malava, where most of the firewood is collected.","2772","GS MS Simplified Methodology for Efficient Cookstoves v1.","Microscale","Standalone",""

The total GHG emission reductions for the 10 years crediting period (2016-2025) are estimated at 453,800 t CO2. The estimated annual average GHG emissions reduction is 45,380 t CO2/year.
Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements because it contributes to local environmental sustainability, since recycling instead of using material from virgin inputs decreases the overall energy use, GHGs and environmental burden caused by natural resources extraction.
At the same time, PET waste recycling reduces the amount of waste to be disposed in the landfill. The project also contributes towards better working conditions and better revenue distribution to improve local and regional economic development, increases employment opportunities in the area; it contributes to the development of new technologies, to regional integration and connection with other sectors, and to a large extent to the local municipalities’ funds for social insurance, such as health and pension funds, and to local and social community development.","45380","AMS-III.AJ.

The applied technology is a ceramic water filter that produces water of safe drinking water quality which is further described in section A.5 below.Prior to the implementation of the proposed project, in the proposed project boundary there is limited access to clean drinking water. Lack of ready access to a water source also limit the quantity of suitable drinking water that is available to a household. Even if the water is obtained from an improved source, water that must be fetched from a source that is not readily accessible to the household and may be contaminated during transport or storage . Nationally, boiling water prior to drinking is the most common treatment method (70.1 percent of total population). The percentage of urban people and rural people boiling water is 60.0 percent and 80.1 percent, respectively . The baseline scenario is the continuation of current practice, thus identical to the existing scenario prior to the implementation of the proposed project.Under the project scenario, the proposed project will reduce GHG emissions by replacing the use of non-renewable biomass or fossil fuel to boil water to purify the water for drinking purposes. This purification method is energy intensive, creates indoor air pollution that is damaging to health, and emits significant GHG. Thus, the project activity contributes to the reduction in the GHG gas emissions associated to fossil fuel combustion for obtaining safe drinking water (SDW) as per conventional methods of water purification and also provides access to SDW to the consumers at an affordable price. The project activity will result in an annual average CO2 emission reduction of 37,277 tCO2e and 372,774 tCO2e over a 10 year crediting period.

The rehabilitation of those boreholes/wells reduces the need for households to boil water as a means of purification. New boreholes might be drilled in case that this would reveal to be more favourable than rehabilitating boreholes/wells. 
Many existing boreholes in the districts of Rusizi, Ngoma, Rwamagana and Bugesera have fallen into disrepair because of lack of systematic maintenance programmes and due to insufficient financial means in the districts. The project aims to repair and maintain around 50 boreholes/wells  across the 4 districts. Any borehole/pump technology can be involved in the project activity. However, it is foreseen that the most common technologies will be of Afridev or India Mark. 
The rehabilitated boreholes/wells will be properly maintained in form of both preventive and corrective maintenance and water coming from the water points will be periodically tested for E.coli bacteria in order to guarantee safe and clean water over the time. 
It is planned to establish a WASH committee for each borehole.

The project will be registered as VPA-2 under the PoA “Efficient cookstoves in Benin and Togo"".The project area includes more than 10,000 households for a total population of 114,012 inhabitants (2013 Census) in the municipalities of Toucountouna and Ouaké. These are areas with a large rural population mainly using wood-energy with traditional three stones cookstoves.More than 3,500 households will have the Wanrou efficient cookstoves, since this type of efficient cookstove has not encountered any socio-cultural adoption barriers in previous experiments in 58 villages in the department of Atacora. About 300 rural women will be trained and equipped as instructors for the construction of the Wanrou efficient cookstove in their villages and surroundings.The Wanrou efficient cookstoves represent an accessible solution to improve the energy efficiency of cooking and limit the overconsumption of wood-energy, and will gradually replace the traditional three stones cookstoves. By reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass, the Wanrou efficient cookstoves will also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while preserving forests, ecosystems and biodiversity. These efficient cookstoves are a solution currently deployed in the region by Eco-Benin to combat energy poverty and use the potential for the generation of carbon credits. The use of the Wanrou efficient cookstoves with smoke exhaust chimneys also reduces the number of cases of respiratory diseases, reduces the time spent by women and children to collect firewood, and creates local jobs through the construction of the Wanrou efficient coosktoves. In addition to the promotion of the Wanrou stoves the project will deploy at least 8 solar kiosks and foresee 100 Wanrou cookstoves with a thermal electric generator which will allow to charge a mobile phone and/or LED lamp.

The energy – efficient stoves in this VPA also known as improved cook stoves (ICS), are designed by a team of experts, scientists and engineers at Envirofit.In the absence of project activity, the traditional inefficient cook stoves, commonly referred to as chulhas, would have been used for cooking – producing substantial GHG emissions due to burning of non renewable biomass. A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution . The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions.","22616","AMS-II.G.

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

Its energy efficient stand-alone project activity registered with the Clean Development Mechanism and the Gold Standard is capable of bringing a cleaner, healthier and environmentally friendly technology to low-income individuals, especially women and children, by changing the traditional cooking practices used in schools in Uganda. Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder.
Simoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. 
Simoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities. Nevertheless, they play a crucial role in the school finances, the health impact for children and cooks, the deforestation impact and subsequent CO2 emissions","30072","AMS-II.G.

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008","18768","AMS-I.D.

A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution .  The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions.","22678","AMS-II.G.

Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009.","61769","AMS-I.C.

The project is owned and operated by Hanbao Livestock & Farming Products Company, Ltd. and implemented on their pig farm in Fangyuan Township, Changhua County, Taiwan. The project involves the capture of biogas from the pig farm’s wastewater treatment facility and the construction of a biogas generation plant to utilize the recovered biogas for electricity production. The project also involves the installation of wind turbines and solar PV. Currently, the biogas generation plant has an installed capacity of 65KW with another 195kw to be installed, for an installed capacity of 260KW. Currently, the solar PV system has an installed capacity of 963KW with another 490KW to be installed, for an installed capacity of 1,453KW. The project will also involve the construction of wind turbines with an installed capacity of 51KW. Thus, the current installed renewable energy capacity is 1,028KW and the future total installed capacity will be 1,764KW. The completed project will produce an estimated 3,776MWh annually. Social and Environmental Benefits(1) Reduced methane emissions – Methane-rich biogas is a byproduct of waste decomposition. In the absence of the project, GHG emissions in the form of methane would be released directly into the atmosphere. The project will prevent methane emissions by capturing the biogas associated with pig waste treatment. (2) Renewable energy generation – The use of wind, solar, and biogas generated electricity neither creates water and air pollution not does it contribute to global climate change. Another benefit of domestic renewable energy is the decreased dependence on increasingly expensive imported fuel, most of which is highly polluting fossil fuel.","11835","AMS-I.D.

"3434","GS3434 Uberlândia landfills I and II","Energas Geracao de Energia Ltda","Gold Standard Certified Project","3,7,13","Biogas - Electricity","Brazil","The objective of the Uberlândia landfills I and II is to collect the landfill gas produced in the Uberlândia Landfill and use it to generate electricity. A total capacity of 2.80 MW will be installed, composed by 2 engines with individual capacity of 1.4 MW each. The project is expected to export 354,968  MWh during its lifetime.Uberlândia Landfill comprises two adjoining solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), named Landfill I and Landfill II, both owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. (Project Participant). The Landfill I started operating in July of 1995 and stopped receiving waste in September 2010. The Landfill II started operating in October 2010 with the same environmental care applied to the previous disposal site and counts on a qualified and multidisciplinary team of technicians. The landfill has a total area of 300,000 m2, with 200,000 m2 dedicated to disposal of waste, being able to receive till 4,500,000 m3 of solid waste for an approximately 18 years of lifetime. All the area was sealed with a membrane of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and compacted clay in order to protect the phreatic layer from contamination. The leachate generated in each landfill is given a different treatment. For Landfill I the leachate is treated at an ascendant flow anaerobic reactor followed by an anaerobic filter and then sent to the Uberabinha’s sewage treatment station (ETE Uberabinha) through municipal canalization. The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto – DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Uberlândia landfills I and II project activity at the Uberlândia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfill’s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the Uberlândia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil – some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, São João Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central – CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas Geração de Energia Ltda., composed by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and Asja Brasil Serviços para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project.","218407","ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008","18768","AMS-I.D.

"2564","Expanding access to LPG in Haiti through microfinance services","Entrepreneurs du Monde","Gold Standard Certified Project","3,7,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Haiti","In Haiti more than 90% of the population cooks on charcoal-based stoves and do so using so called traditional ones. Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households. Indeed, the combustion of charcoal with traditional stoves, generates toxic gas in the air.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cook stove,  instead  of  a  traditional  one,  means  the  end  user  is  saving significant amount of money because less fuel is needed for her/his cooking needs.","8623","GS TPDDTEC v 1.","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.","42222","AMS-II.G.

Ltd.","Gold Standard Certified Project","1,3,6,8,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Lao People's Democratic Republic","In Lao PDR, the surface water is plentiful but frequently it is of very poor quality and not safe to drink especially in rural areas. Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water.
TerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWP’s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour.  Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWP’s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs.
 
With the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWP’s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012.  With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR.","33541","GS TPDDTEC v 1.","Small Scale","Standalone",""

Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (“Ministère de l’environnement et du développement durable""). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  “Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user.","8877","GS TPDDTEC v 2.","Micro scale","Standalone",""
